Hey! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“Œ Iâ€™m Peter Morganelli, a computer science major at Tufts University working as a software developer at Tufts's JumboCode on the Somerville Museum team, previously on the Theatre@First team. I am passionate about learning and applying new technologies to solve real-world problems, which is exactly what we do at Somerville Museum.

ðŸ“² I'm also a Data Structures TA, Founder of Tufts' Leadership Training Institute, and a big Rubik's Cube nerd. I enjoy solving problems, working with people, debugging, pair programming, and good vibes. Please reach out or check out my [portfolio website](https://petermorganelli.vercel.app) for more info about me!
